    - prompt: "Recent studies establish that most people are willing to skydive. In these studies, 70% of people told the researcher they were willing to skydive. Identify the conclusion."
      explanation: "The key verb is “establish.” That is a very strong verb. It’s short for “establishes as a fact.” That’s saying that the studies (which are a premise of the argument) conclusively prove the conclusion (which is the latter part of the sentence). Other strong verbs that could have been used here (non-exhaustive): shows, proves, indicates, suggests, supports, etc. All of these provide connective tissue between the observable fact (premise) and the claim being made (conclusion)."
