    - prompt: "Premise 1: A → B. Premise 2: A—most→C. Which of the following inferences is valid?"
      explanation: "When an 'all' statement and a 'most' statement share a common variable that is in the sufficient condition of the 'all' statement. There will be at least 'some' overlap between the other two variables. Because this template did not allow you to drag-and-drop the 'A⎯most→C' directly to the left of 'A→B', you have to settle for a 'some' conclusion between the other two variables."

      explanation: "When an 'all' statement and a 'most' statement share a common variable that is in the sufficient condition of the 'all' statement. There will be at least 'some' overlap between the other two variables. Because this template did allow you to drag-and-drop the 'A⎯most→C' directly to the left of 'A→B', you are able to conclude that 'most' C's are B's."
