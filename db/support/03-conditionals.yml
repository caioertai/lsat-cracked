  - prompt: "How do you diagram: 'Clara attends if but only if Diana attends?"
    explanation: "“If and only if” or “If but only if” contains “if” (sufficient) and “only if” (necessary) so it introduces both the sufficient and necessary. The result: you either get: (1) both of them or (2) neither of them. (Having exactly 1 of the 2 is never an option). We use a double arrow to represent this."

  - prompt: "How do you diagram: “if the stimulus has a conclusion, it is an argument; else it is not”?"
    explanation: "“If… else” is a somewhat complicated structure. The key is to realize that “else” is pointing back to the sufficient condition and negating it for the second premise that you will then diagram. It therefore divides the universe into one of two possibilities: 1) what happens when you have the sufficient condition and 2) what happens when you don’t have the sufficient condition. Double-arrow."
