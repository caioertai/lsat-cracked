    - prompt: "Three years ago the city of Smallville added an additional 5,000 police officers. Since that time, crime has decreased by 15%.</br></br>Which one of the following is a valid inference?"
      explanation: "This is a Coincidence != Causation template. Just because A immediately preceeded B, it does not necessarily mean that A caused B. (Although, since B occured after A, you know that B cannot have caused A.) Still, there is always the possibility that some unkown alternate cause could have caused the observed result, which is why we cannot reach a definitive conclusion regarding causation."
      answers:
      - content: "The addition of more police preceeded the decrease in crime, but we cannot say for certain that it caused it."
        correct: true

    - prompt: "Countries that watch the most YouTube videos per capita tend to have the lowest rates of Alzheimer's disease.</br></br>Which one of the following is a valid inference?"
      explanation: "This is a Correlation != Causation template. Here, A shares a statistical pattern with B (known as an 'inverse' or 'negative' correlation, and represented as Y↑A↓). This does not necessarily mean that YouTube is certainly the cause of the lower Alzheimer's rates. The other two possibilties are that: 1) Alzheimer's causes less YouTube watching; and 2) YouTube could be positively correlated with some third variable (e.g. youth) and this factor might actually be the true cause. Hence, you can never move from correlation to causation."

    - prompt: "The weight of bowling balls increase in direct proportion to their size. The same relationship holds among beach balls.</br></br>If the statements above are true, which of the following is a valid statement?"
      explanation: "Just because the relationship holds within the bowling ball group and within the beach ball group it doesn’t mean that you can compare across the two groups. Just because a large beach ball is heavier than a small beach ball, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the largest beach ball is heavier than the smallest bowling ball. Perhaps beach balls are far lighter than bowling balls, so it’s actually the case that even the largest beach ball is still lighter than the smallest bowling ball."
      answers:
      - content: "If the average beach ball is larger in size than the average bowling ball, then the average beach ball weighs more than the average bowling ball."

    - prompt: "I asked the first five people I saw outside my local coffee shop if they read books regularly or decided to let their brain die and watch Netflix. Three of the people said they read books. Therefore, more than half of the people in my city read books.</br></br>Which one of the following does NOT describe a flaw in the argument above?"
      explanation: "Lots of flaws here. People patronizing (or at least near) a coffee shop may be more (or less) likely than the average person in my city to read books. Five people is a clearly inadequate sample. Notice that we did not need a cross-section of all Americans—we just needed people in my city, since that is what the scope of the conclusion is about. The scope of the conclusion determines how “representative” the sampled population needs to be. People may have lied because they wanted to appear a certain way (educated) in front of the pollster. Finally, the question was biased in favor of books and against not reading (the judgmental phrasing of 'let their brain die' may make people more likely to lean in that direction when reporting their answer)."

    - prompt: "Rowan was crossing the street and saw an elderly person about to be struck by a large vehicle. Rowan could have guided the person out of the way with no risk or inconvenience to himself. Therefore, Rowan should have helped the elderly person.</br></br>Which one of the following, *if added to the argument*, would make this a valid argument?"
      explanation: "Don’t assume any moral code. Any argument that reaches a prescriptive (e.g. 'should' or 'ought') conclusion needs a prescriptive premise to support it; otherwise, it is automatcally a bad argument. That's true even when the prescriptive principle that's missing is very 'obvious' to all good, moral people.</br></br>In order to fix this argument and be able to conclude that Rowan 'should' take a given action, we want a premise that places 'should act' in the *necessary* condition of the answer choice (or that places 'should not act' in the sufficient condition, paired with a necessary condition that is negated by our facts)."

      explanation: "We start with 3 dishonest politicians and triple that amount, resulting in 9. We then triple that amount (9*3), resulting in 27.
