    - prompt: "If a motor is sound-insulated, then it is quiet enough to use in home appliances. If a motor is quiet enough to use in home appliances, then it can be used in institutional settings. None of the motors manufactured by EM Industries are quiet enough to use in home appliances.</br></br>If the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?"
      explanation: "On MBT stems the key is to comprehend the set of facts you’ve read and to pay attention to any strong claims that you can diagram. This stimulus is chock full of statements we can diagram, and the first two premises are presented in a very-easy-to-link transitive chain. Diagram it and take the contrapositive.</br></br>SI → QHE → UIS	[~UIS → ~QHE → ~SI]</br></br>We are then given one additional fact: EM Industries doesn’t have a single motor that qualifies as QHE.</br></br>The proper way to diagram this is: EM → ~QHE. This allows you to make a transitive link with what we have above:</br></br>EM → ~QHE → ~SI</br></br>We can now infer that EM does not make any motors that are sound-insulated. Likewise, we can say that if a motor is sound-insulated then EM motors did not make it. Let’s find one of those two claims in the answer choices."

      answers:
        - content: "If a motor can be used in institutional settings, then it is sound-insulated."
          correct: false
          explanation: "This starts us out in the necessary condition (UIS), so I immediately eliminate it, as there is no way it can say a MBT statement. It ends up, of course, doing the Converse Fallacy by claiming UIS → SI. This will be the most common type of wrong answer you’ll encounter on MBT stems."
        - content: "None of the motors manufactured by EM Industries are sound-insulated."
          correct: true
          explanation: "Bingo. Exactly the transitive link discussed above."
        - content: "At least some of the motors manufactured by EM Industries can be used in institutional settings."
          correct: false
          explanation: "At least some of the motors manufactured by EM Industries can be used in institutional settings. I would flag this on the first pass because it requires me to think for more than two seconds. Upon closer inspection we see that we can’t even make this weak of a “some” claim. Notice that there is “some” overlap between EM, ~QHE, and ~SI, but no necessary overlap with the key term here of “UIS”."
        - content: "If a motor is quiet enough to use in home appliances, then it is sound-insulated."
          correct: false
          explanation: "Converse Fallacy of the first conditional statement we diagrammed."
        - content: "None of the motors manufactured by EM Industries can be used in institutional settings."
          correct: false
          explanation: "We can conclude ~SI but we can’t necessarily conclude that all of them are ~UIS. Doing so would be going against our transitive arrow. If you were tempted by this it means you thought you could move from ~QHE to ~UIS, which you cannot do."

    - prompt: "Some people believe that advertising is socially pernicious—it changes consumers' preferences, thereby manipulating people into wanting things they would not otherwise want. However, classes in music and art appreciation change people's preferences for various forms of art and music, and there is nothing wrong with these classes. Therefore, _______.</br></br>Which one of the following most logically completes the argument?"
      explanation: "For Argument Competition stems that ask for the conclusion, you can think of the right answer choice as a subset of all possible MBT answer choices. The correct answer must be both a MBT claim as well as a reasonable “main point” for the argument to conclude with.</br></br>In practice this distinction rarely matters, as eliminating all of the answer choices that are NNT or MBF will generally purge all four imposters.</br></br>With an incomplete argument you want to understand the structure of what’s been said so far as well as pay attention to any structural hints on where the argument may be going in terms of the conclusion. Notice the template of “some people believe…” which indicates a very high likelihood that our conclusion will attempt to contradict that in some way.</br></br>The argument then provides a premise that shows a single example where advertising changed someone’s preferences and yet we would all agree that it is not pernicious. So we won’t be able to say that advertising is never bad, but we can at least say that it isn’t always bad."

        - content: "consumers would still want most of the things they want even if they were not advertised"

        - content: "the social perniciousness of advertising is not limited to its effect on people's preferences"
          correct: false
          explanation: "Out of scope, as we are only responding to the claim that advertising is socially pernicious. We certainly aren’t going out of our way to pile on and say there are other things that are bad about advertising."
        - content: "the fact that advertising changes consumers' preferences does not establish that it is bad"
          correct: true
          explanation: "Perfect. We provided a single example where we had a change in customer preference (CCP) and yet it was not bad (~B). You can mentally model that as fully disproving the notion that “changing customer preference is automatically bad” (CCP → B). Another way of saying that arrow statement is false is to say that (CCP) “doesn’t establish” (B)—precisely what our answer choice says."
        - content: "if advertising changes consumers' preferences, it generally does so in a positive way"
          correct: false
          explanation: "NNT. We were provided with a single non-bad example; we cannot say that most examples are good."
        - content: "it is not completely accurate to say that advertising changes people's preferences"
          correct: false
          explanation: "We never dispute that advertising changes peoples’ preferences. Rather we just show that it isn’t always necessarily bad that it does so."
