    <h2 class="h1 mb-5 text-center font-weight-bold">The LSAT Cracked Difference</h2>
    <p>Mass-market LSAT courses operate on a standard business model: license 8,000 questions, overwhelm you with hundreds of hours of videos, and expect you to see the patterns for yourself. <strong>LSAT Cracked is different:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li class="bg-primary-dark p-3 mb-3"><strong>LSAT Cracked saves you time by identifying and teaching you the exact skills that LSAT writers care about.</strong> Once you master these skills, you will “see” LSAT problems differently, and your score will improve dramatically.</li>
      <li class="bg-primary-dark p-3 mb-3"><strong>The LSAT Cracked experience is modular and hyper-specific.</strong> No three-hour lectures that you'll never pay attention to. Instead, we target precise skill gaps with micro-lessons and explanations.</li>
      <li class="bg-primary-dark p-3 mb-3"><strong>LSAT Cracked meets you where you're at.</strong> Unlike mass-market courses that "teach to the middle", LSAT Cracked's curriculum is simultaneously more beginner-friendly (comprehensive coverage of logic fundamentals if you need it), while also providing the nuance and rigor required for students looking to score deep in the 99th percentile. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The most common sentiment I hear from my students:
      <i>“I wish I heard about you before I wasted $2,000 on [mass-market course XYZ].”</i>
      The LSAT is the most important test of your life. Don’t trust it to a mass-market LSAT course. Let’s get started today.

    <h2 class="h1 mb-5 text-center font-weight-bold">LSAT Cracked Approach</h2>
    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">1. A world-class LSAT curriculum</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">Over 300 pages detailing the exact skills you need to learn for LSAT mastery. No fluff, no filler. The curriculum is extremely modular so that you can locate the exact skill you'd like to learn more about without having to read 20 pages or listen to an hour of video.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">2. Custom software quizzes with explanations</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">When you read a chapter you won't have to wonder if you've absorbed the content—you can immediately quiz yourself to see which specific areas need more attention.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">3. Modular video explanations</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">No one pays attention to four-hour LSAT lectures, but that's what typical mass-market courses use. LSAT Cracked presents short (< 5min) videos on the key skills you need to master.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">4. Exclusive weekly office hours</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">Take advantage of exclusive weekly office hours. For 90 minutes each week, I answer student questions, highlighting the key skills and themes that make the question relevant for the entire audience.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">5. One-on-one private coaching sessions</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">Spend an hour with me on everything from customizing an ideal LSAT plan to your specific schedule and goals to uncovering the idiosyncratic patterns that explain your mistakes.</p>
