    <h2 class="h1 mb-5 text-center font-weight-bold">LSAT Cracked Approach</h2>
    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">1. A world-class LSAT curriculum</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">Over 300 pages detailing the exact skills you need to learn for LSAT mastery. No fluff, no filler. The curriculum is extremely modular so that you can locate the exact skill you'd like to learn more about without having to read 20 pages or listen to an hour of video.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">2. Custom software quizzes with explanations</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">When you read a chapter you won't have to wonder if you've absorbed the content—you can immediately quiz yourself to see which specific areas need more attention.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">3. Modular video explanations</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">No one pays attention to four-hour LSAT lectures, but that's what typical mass-market courses use. LSAT Cracked presents short (< 5min) videos on the key skills you need to master.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">4. Exclusive weekly office hours</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">Take advantage of exclusive weekly office hours. For 90 minutes each week, I answer student questions, highlighting the key skills and themes that make the question relevant for the entire audience.</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-weight-bolder">5. One-on-one private coaching sessions</h3>
    <p class="pl-4 mb-4">Spend an hour with me on everything from customizing an ideal LSAT plan to your specific schedule and goals to uncovering the idiosyncratic patterns that explain your mistakes.</p>
